In Part II the focus was prototyping my initial ideas and getting feedback on how to improve--what my final message would be, who the audience was for my data visualization, and what the design itself would look like. The critiques I received from my colleagues helped me narrow down the story I was telling, especially the comments about creating visualizations that were engaging but not overly designed. Simple was better, in this case.

I also changed some of the text itself to create a more conversational tone, as my initial wireframe felt more like a lecture about the economic, environmental, and ethical dimensions of fair trade coffee. Framing the topic as a conversation made the visualization & presentation feel more *personal*, like something one would actually discuss over a cup of coffee. Removing some of the more "academic" and industry-specific language made the narrative itself flow a little better, but I do feel like it is a bit long and over-explanatory. I tried to find a balance between giving the viewer enough context and information so they weren't confused, and not bombarding them with data and graphs. The resulting visualizations I think straddle that line, but the story is not as succinct as I would like it to be.

### My Final Audience

My audience remained very similar to what I described in Part II--coffee drinkers who might have some vague notion of what goes on behind the scenes with some of the most consumed brands in the world, but not a grasp on the bigger picture of just how global the issues in the coffee supply chain are. The major changes I made were more on the side of crafting a narrative that fit what my colleagues told me could be improved on, like "simplifying" my message and making visualizations that were more dynamic and fit the story. 

### Design Decisions

I wanted the color scheme of my final product to reflect the topic itself: lots of light and bright shades of brown, forest greens, and even some splashes of red to capture the color of ripened coffee cherries before they are turned into coffee beans.
