In Part II the focus was prototyping my initial ideas and getting feedback on how to improve--what my final message would be, who the audience was for my data visualization, and what the design itself would look like. The critiques I received from my colleagues helped me narrow down the story I was telling, especially the comments about creating visualizations that were engaging but not overly designed. Simple was better, in this case.

I also changed some of the text itself to create a more conversational tone, as my initial wireframe felt more like a lecture about the economic, environmental, and ethical dimensions of fair trade coffee. Framing the topic as a conversation made the visualization & presentation feel more *personal*, like something one would actually discuss over a cup of coffee. Removing some of the more "academic" and industry-specific language made the narrative itself flow a little better, but I do feel like it is a bit long and over-explanatory. I tried to find a balance between giving the viewer enough context and information so they weren't confused, and not bombarding them with data and graphs. The resulting visualizations I think straddle that line, but the story is not as succinct as I would like it to be.
