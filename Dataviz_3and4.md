## Critique by Design

This assignment was twofold: find a data visualization out in the wild that could use a bit of a tune-up and identify areas of improvement; and wireframe, then design, a solution that makes the data more readable, understandable, and pretty to look at. I chose to look at [this](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/graphic-science-caffeine-high-more-and-more-products-contain-large-doses/) visualization from *Scientific American*, mapping out how much caffeine is in everyday products--not just coffee, but water, chocolate, and jelly beans. The idea behind the viz is to highlight just how much caffeine we are consuming beyond the regular fare of coffee, tea, and energy drinks, and while I think the viz is a good first attempt, as I'll explain soon there is way too much happening in way too small a space...

#### Here is the original visualization
