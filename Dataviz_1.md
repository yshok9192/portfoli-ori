Data taken from the OECD website. A very general bar chart of each country's overall government debt as a percentage of their GDP. Note, for example, that Japan's Debt-to-GDP ratio is far and away the most stark, although this may not be cause for alarm -- Japan is a high-income country with a relatively high population so the government may borrow and go into debt to fund services and projects that will produce a return on their investment. This ratio is not the whole story for any country, but can give viewers a sense of where the trend is going.
