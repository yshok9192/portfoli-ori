## Visualizing Government Data

On the OECD website there is an interactive chart where one can select countries to focus on, and even compare to draw conclusions as necessary regarding how well one is doing compared to others. However, it can only show so much in a bar chart and be accessible to the lay public--someone with little knowledge of governmental debt's role in a nation's economy can hover over the United States bar and see that in 2020 its general governmental debt was 162% of GDP, and without more context walk away not fully understanding what that means. The eye jumps immediately to the right side of the graph, which may distort the story that these data are trying to tell.

A very general bar chart of each country's overall government debt as a percentage of their GDP. Note, for example, that Japan's Debt-to-GDP ratio is far and away the most stark, although this may not be cause for alarm -- Japan is a high-income country with a relatively high population so the government may borrow and go into debt to fund services and projects that will produce a return on their investment. This ratio is not the whole story for any country, but can give viewers a sense of where the trend is going.

Line charts, in my opinion, better portray trends over time than bar charts--this is an imperfect way to present these data, as the charts are small and don't feature as much granular information, but one look at them and you can see how different each country's Debt-to-GDP ratio changes over the years. A grouping by region could tell us even more about economic health and activity around the world, but in general these charts are a helpful tool.

I struggled to find a visualization method that would capture the complexity of the data and would not be overly complicated. Specifically, I wanted to present these data in such a way that someone coming across them could intuitively tell how countries' Debt-to-GDP ratio grows and shrinks over time--especially after the 2008-9 financial crash. This packed circle graph felt closest to accomplishing my goal: each circle changes in size from year to year, and the time slider adds an animation element to the story. Countries with larger economies, like Japan and the United States, engage in large-scale borrowing to fund critical social services and other governmental projects, but Greece's high Debt-to-GDP ratio could indicate a return to pre-Eurozone crisis economic stability as it no longer needs to implement harsh austerity measures.
