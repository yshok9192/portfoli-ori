I love coffee. I love it a lot--some might say too much. There was a time when I would consume at least five cups a day just to get going in the morning ☕☕☕☕☕ my coffee consumption has slowed significantly, but I can't imagine a world in which I couldn't readily access that sweet bean water. But.....

#### As a commodity, coffee is resource-intensive and can place a burden on the economies and ecosystems in which it is grown and harvested. I don't say this to make anyone feel bad about drinking coffee--least of all, me!--but I believe it is important to understand the larger impact coffee has on the countries and people who have primary, direct interaction with it. Like any widely produced and consumed product, there are benefits and significant drawbacks and I think that, as coffee drinkers, we should remember that when we make our morning cup or walk into a cafe for the midday caffeine hit.

In this project I am going to focus specifically on [Fair Trade coffee](https://www.fairtrade.net/product/coffee). It is often marketed and described as an alternative to more conventional coffee companies--e.g. Starbucks, Dunkin--for its more equitable labor practices and fair prices to a network of growers around the world. 

* Worldwide consumption (who drinks the most coffee? What does the global market look like?)
* Production (How much water does coffee need to grow? Who grows the most? How much of their GDP is coffee production?)
* Ecological Impacts (What does coffee production do to an area? How do other organisms get impacted?)
* Climate Change (What effects will rising CO2 have on coffee? Bees are disappearing--what does that mean for coffee?)
* Labor (Is coffee production exploitative? What labor issues arise in the industry?)

This will not be a deep deep dive into the world of coffee, as that would be a book-length exploration of the different ways it affects our world, but I hope to highlight a few key aspects of the industry and our relationship to it as consumers. 

#### The Story Arc

Intro & Setup - A brief overview and history of coffee production and consumption...and I mean *brief*, because coffee has been cultivated and consumed by humans for thousands of years, and this is not a history of coffee! Readers will see a series of data visualizations showing how much coffee has proliferated not just our taste buds and city landscapes, but the economies of several countries and the physical landscape of the earth itself. This will come in the form of quick facts (e.g. 1.4 billion cups of coffee were consumed a day in 2021), maps showing where coffee is most consumed and produced, the health benefits (or detriments!) of the drink, and more. 

Problem - Coffee production complicates the relationship we have with the drink, and that should be a cause for concern but not total hopelessness! It is, however, an industry with serious issues around environmental degradation, ecological issues, and exploitative labor proactices (including child labor, in some cases) *I will add a content warning here* Like any commodity, there are inherent capitalist pressures to minimize costs and maximize profits, and because coffee is such a widely consumed commodity the issues inherent in capitalism are all on display.

Body - Some discussion of coffee's role in colonial projects throughout the 20th century (e.g. Brazil and its long history of coffee production), the environmental impact of coffee production around the world, the effects of climate change on coffee and vice versa, labor practices in America and around the world (e.g. Starbucks has been caught using prison labor)

ALTERNATE: Fair Trade & Organic (FTO) coffee vs. other forms (e.g. Starbucks, Dunkin) -- 

Resolution - Taking action! Pushing for more equitable coffee production practices, calling out corporations for unethical activities, etc.

#### Initial Sketches

I should preface this by saying that these are *very rough* and will very much not be the final product.

#### Data Collection

I plan on using a combination of publicly available datasets from the US Dept. of Agriculture, the World Trade Organization, Our World in Data, Statista, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, and a number of research papers and news articles about coffee consumption and production; labor practices; environmental impacts, and ecological impacts. 

[This article](https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/coffee.pdf) from the USDA gives a high-level overview of coffee markets and trade around the world, and I will be primarily drawing from the data table in the latter half of the article to produce an interactive visualization; because it is a static table in a PDF, I will use Tabula to pull the numbers into a .csv file. [These datasets](https://www.statista.com/topics/5945/coffee-market-worldwide/#dossierKeyfigures) from Statista go into more granular detail about specific coffee-growing regions, and [these](https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food?country=) from Our World in Data go into detail about the environmental impacts of production of different products. 

These are just examples of the data I will be drawing from, but to supplement these data I have found a series of news articles from The Guardian, TIME, Business Insider, and Vox; additionally, data and reporting on labor practices in the coffee industry come from non-governmental and watchdog organizations to tell a fuller story of the impacts of coffee. Journal and scholarly articles are also going to play a huge role in my story--for example, [this](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-263X.2008.00033.x) paper about the impact of changing production standards on forest ecosystems in Ethiopia will supplement my overall narrative with both prose and data.

My data sources for this project are all in a bibliography I have created, and can be accessed [here](file:///Users/youssefshokry/Downloads/Telling%20Stories%20w:Data%20Final%20Project.html)

#### Method & Medium

I will be using Tableau and Flourish primarily for producing data visualizations, although those tools to not always have the functionality I am looking for--so I will also use RawGraphs and Datawrapper for visualization. The project will be presented via Shorthand, and my plan is to "take the reader on a journey" from production to consumption of coffee, but the specifics of that journey are to be determined. 

I plan on making use of license-free and publicly available images and visuals from sites like Creative Commons and Unsplash, as I think incorporating as much of a visual element as possible will enhance the overall story I am telling.

Let's go! ☕
