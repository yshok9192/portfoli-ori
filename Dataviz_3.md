With this data visualization, I wanted to highlight what I think is an interesting question: which OECD countries have experienced a high Debt-to-GDP ratio over time? Countries with larger economies, like Japan and the United States, engage in large-scale borrowing to fund critical social services and other governmental projects, but Greece's high Debt-to-GDP ratio could indicate a return to pre-Eurozone crisis economic stability as it no longer needs to implement harsh austerity measures. The size of each circle relative to the others reflects how much more of that country's GDP is taken up by going into debt.
