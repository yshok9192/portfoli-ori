A public portfolio for my projects in Telling Stories With Data at CMU!

## about me

hi all! my name is youssef :) 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98067398/150695345-d065d9f7-edfc-4405-8b43-d2870a0a4c74.JPG" alt="me" width="325" height="450">

my pronouns are he/him [(why do i include this?)](https://prospect.org.uk/news/why-we-should-all-start-using-pronouns)
, and i am originally from the bay area but moved to pittsburgh to get my master's degree in arts management at Carnegie Mellon University. i got my undergraduate degree in anthropology from uc berkeley and spent six years after graduation working at museums in oakland and san francisco before joining Heinz College at CMU.

i am also a huge music nerd! my current favorite genres are metal, electronic, [shoegaze](https://youtu.be/OBxJGg6cjqk), and industrial :metal: 

### more about my museum career
my museum background is visitor services but am hoping to get more experience in museum education -- helping design exhibitions, programs, and events that are accessible to historically underserved communities, and making sure that other museum professionals of color are able to take advantage of as many opportunites as possible in the museum world! 

i am very interested in the intersection of museum work and [Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, and Inclusion](https://www.aam-us.org/category/diversity-equity-inclusion-accessibility/) -- or DEAI -- issues. The last few years have seen a huge shift in American life around how we talk about race and equality, and i believe that the way I can best be part of that shift is advocating for more DEAI-oriented work within museums and cultural institutions.

## what i hope to learn in Telling Stories With Data

i am a relative newcomer to dataviz, and while i am a little nervous to dive headfirst into this world i am also really excited to embark on this journey! i have already gotten started by creating this github page, but am ready to understand some of the visual language and process that undergirds informative, eye-catching, and ultimately beneficial visualizations of the info that is most important to our world today! 

here is an example of a gigamap i made for the class Design Thinking for Complex Systems

not the most elegant dataviz, but i hope that through taking this class i can learn some of the tools to create something a little more pleasing to the eye :)

# Portfolio
here is where i will post all of my projects, both for class and for stuff that i find interesting!
