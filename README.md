## about me

hi all! my name is youssef :) 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98067398/150695345-d065d9f7-edfc-4405-8b43-d2870a0a4c74.JPG" alt="me" width="325" height="450">

my pronouns are he/him [(why do i include this?)](https://prospect.org.uk/news/why-we-should-all-start-using-pronouns)
, and i am originally from the bay area but moved to pittsburgh to get my master's degree in arts management at Carnegie Mellon University. i got my undergraduate degree in anthropology from uc berkeley and spent six years after graduation working at museums in oakland and san francisco before joining Heinz College at CMU.

### more about my museum career
my museum background is visitor services but am hoping to get more experience in museum education -- helping design exhibitions, programs, and events that are accessible to historically underserved communities, and making sure that other museum professionals of color are able to take advantage of as many opportunites as possible in the museum world! 

i am very interested in the intersection of museum work and [Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, and Inclusion](https://www.aam-us.org/category/diversity-equity-inclusion-accessibility/) -- or DEAI -- issues. The last few years have seen a huge shift in American life around how we talk about race and equality, and i believe that the way I can best be part of that shift is advocating for more DEAI-oriented work within museums and cultural institutions.
> *fun fact: another common acronym is JEDI - Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion*
