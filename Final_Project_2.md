Now that I have my project narrowed down in scope a little more and created a rough road map of the story I want to tell--Fair Trade is a viable, if imperfect, alternative to conventional coffee--I need to mock-up a sample final product, made in a style that is reminiscent of the storytelling site [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/), and share that with three friends/colleagues/internet strangers (not actually that last one) to get user feedback that will inform the actual final product. 

My process at this stage will be to:
1. ~~Turn my notebook sketches into a sample, using the wireframing site [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)~~ This step is complete! You can access my mock-up [here](https://balsamiq.cloud/sfjn3f5/pif1jdd).
2. Create a user research protocol that will structure the remainder of my back-end work on this project. The protocol will focus on:
   - My target audience
   - My approach to reaching out to the individuals whom I will ask for critique and feedback
   - My interview script
   - Interview findings
   - Changes I plan on incorporating into the final product
3. Send the mock-up to one friend for intial critique and feedback--I am only sending it out to one person to start because I want to hone in on specific areas where my initial idea can be refined.
4. Incorporate that feedback into a new iteration of the mock-up, this time creating a sample page in Shorthand itself and adding in the text, data, and visualizations I will create. 
5. Send this version to two people for critique and feedback. Repeat steps 3 & 4.

I also want to create a moodboard for this project--something to give the viewer/reader a sense of what is in my head aesthetically. Get ready for lots of images of coffee being roasted, made, picked, etc. ☕

## Protocol

### Who is my Audience?
Coffee drinkers, generally! More specifically, coffee drinkers who might have some vague notion of what goes on behind the scenes with some of the most consumed brands in the world, but not a grasp on the bigger picture of just how global the issues in the coffee supply chain are. For example, there is a vague notion of Starbucks not having the best labor practices in their supply chain, but the situation changes when one learns that Starbucks has been [caught using slave labor in Brazil](https://fairworldproject.org/starbucks-has-a-slave-labor-problem/).

Now, I think it is important to mention here that **My goal is not to make anyone feel bad or guilty for buying or drinking coffee from large companies--individual consumer choices are just one element (and a small one) in a capitalist system that values and promotes actors who pursue low-cost and high-profit at the expense of individuals, communites, and the planet. Trying to move away from supporting large corporations is important, but there are very real cost and convenience factors that come into play! I hope to provide context and info to viewers of this visualization and provide things they can do to take action in their own lives.**

### How am I picking interviewees?
My interviewees will be people who drink coffee on a regular basis, both conventional brands and companies as well as Fair Trade and small roasters/cafes. They will have a mix of knowledge, familiarity, and understanding of both data visualization and the underlying issues in the coffee industry. 

* Interviewee #1 is a close colleague of mine, someone pursuing a PhD but whose focus is not related to dataviz but who cares about the issue of labor rights, environmental degradation and climate change, and supporting local business. They "love a good infographic", so their perspective will help guide my final product's layout and messaging.
* Interviewee #2 works with large datasets as part of their job, has more familiarity with dataviz, and also has an interest in the topic of coffee and fair trade practices. 
* Interviewee #3 is an avid coffee drinker, and tries to purchase and consume Fair Trade coffee as much as they can. They don't have any real familiarity with dataviz.

### The Script
I am using a Google Doc to share the link to my mock-up and ask interview questions of each interviewee; this will allow me to compile each interviewee's responses into one place and organize them into themes that will inform my next iteration of the final product. My script to each interviewee is as follows:

Thank you for your time in looking at this data visualization mockup! I appreciate your feedback, insight, and constructive critique, as it will help me create the strongest visualization I can make. I want to let you know that *your responses to these questions will be incorporated into a record of my process in this final project, but your name or other identifying information will not be included in any element of my final write-up.* Again, thank you!

- **Prior to looking at mock-up**
  - How aware are you of the topic? 
  - What phrases/words come to mind when you hear the topic?

- **Post-viewing**
  - What phrases/words come to mind after looking at the mock-up?
  - If you had to describe the project in one sentence, what would you say?
  - What did you think about the presentation of information?
  - What did you find informative?
  - Could you perceive a “story”? Do you feel like you know more about the topic?
  - What did you think needed improvement?
  - If you did not know anything about the topic, how would you feel after looking at this visualization?
  - Did you feel there was info missing, or did this feel “incomplete”?

- **Data Visualization**
  - Did the (placeholder) visualizations enhance the story? 
  - Were there data elements you felt were missing?
  - Was any data superfluous/unnecessary to tell the story?
  - Last thoughts/recommendations for the data visualizations?

- **Final Thoughts**
  - What three words/phrases do you think the creator of this visualization mock-up should keep in mind for future iterations?
  - Last thoughts re: storytelling
  - Last thoughts re: data visualizations

### Interview Findings--Critique and Feedback

Reading over my colleagues' notes and feedback for my wireframe sample, a few key points stuck out in particular:
   - Visualizations will help the viewer better digest the information, and my story did not have many visualizations--either dataviz or images. One colleague told me that they *"frankly feel a little irritated - like there was more information right there and I just couldn’t have it."* This is something I knew going in but should definitely keep in mind and make sure to put extra time into when creating my visualizations for the final product.
   - There is a general understanding of the issues I present in my sample, and the narrative I present was coherent and easy to follow. Again, the element of dataviz and images is something I need to focus on, but knowing that the story itself is follow-able is a good sign.
   - Elements of the content itself, for example the difference between "Fair Trade" and "Fair Trade Premium", could be better explained--one colleaugue wrote that "some of the language wasn’t completely accessible, I didn't know what arable meant." This tells me that I need to fill out more of the narrative structure I have created.

#### More Specific Quotes and Areas of Improvement

| Interview Question|Response from Colleague |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Presentation of Information**|"Easily digestible (pun intended). The font is a little kooky as it appears to be shifting and could perhaps be swapped for a more mature-looking sans serif. The journey is laid out well, and it’s an approachable and kind tone." "The informal language style at certain moments makes this feel more accessible and conversational. Graphics and charts are helpful with this kind of info." "Very thorough. The presenter is well-informed and looks at the topic from multiple angles."|
|**Summation of Project in One Sentence**|"Fair trade is one way that we have attempted to address the negative impact of coffee production, which is promising though imperfect." "An informative critique of Fair Trade coffee." "While coffee consumption may be enormously popular, there are significant improvements to be made and Fair Trade practices are one of the answers."|
|**Data Visualization**|"[The placeholders] frankly felt a little irritating - like there was more information right there and I just couldn’t have it." "Part of me wanted to know more about companies with fair trade violations--if there was a visual on that. If there was one about where the money is really going--if that was broken down in a visualization." "Visualizations with color components are helpful to drawing in the eye, and for quick and easy dissection."|
|**Words/Phrases to Keep in Mind**|"Concrete examples that go with the content. Personable language was very helpful." "Impact, supporting photos, next steps." "Audience, feelings, empowered choices...Make me want to look at it"| 

### Changes to Make

Obviously, *adding visualizations to my next mock-up is going to be Priority #1.* I knew that this sample would be inherently lacking due to the absence of visual elements that add the data element to my story that is the central focus of this project. Additionally, I need to revisit the outline I created for this project and add in the following:

- Discussion/data sources for my text about Starbucks getting caught using exploitative labor, but more broadly more concrete pieces of info to fill out my story. I have some ideas of what to add, and research with data tables to draw from, so I just need to incorporate those elements into the next iteration of my story page.
- Additional data and narrative around the issues with the Fair Trade certification, e.g. how it can negatively impact small-scale farmers while profiting distributors and large cooperatives. What is present at the moment is bare bones, and I know there is more I can add in.
- More calls to action! The two that I included are too vague and the section itself is not complete--I am not happy with it, and I need to dive deeper into what researchers, growers, and non-governmental organizations are reporting about Fair Trade and the ways it can be improved.

Below are some of the data visualizations I plan on adding to the next iteration.

## Moodboard

I want my final product for this project to have a certain aesthetic to it, employing earthier tones and evoking images of hills and jungles ripe with coffee plants. Other visualizations and infographics I have seen discussing coffee tend to use browns and greens, colors associated with the plant before and after picking and harvesting. Additionally, cafe and craft coffee imagery is prevalent, so I will attempt to incorporate that vibe into the final iteration. 

Below is a moodboard I created in Canva!
